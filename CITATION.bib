abstract = {{Realizing the growing number of possible or hypothesized metastable crystalline materials is extremely challenging. There is no rigorous metric to identify which compounds can or cannot be synthesized. We present a thermodynamic upper limit on the energy scale, above which the laboratory synthesis of a polymorph is highly unlikely. The limit is defined on the basis of the amorphous state, and we validate its utility by effectively classifying more than 700 polymorphs in 41 common inorganic material systems in the Materials Project for synthesizability. The amorphous limit is highly chemistry-dependent and is found to be in complete agreement with our knowledge of existing polymorphs in these 41 systems, whether made by the nature or in a laboratory. Quantifying the limits of metastability for realizable compounds, the approach is expected to find major applications in materials discovery.}},

abstract = {{Native surface films play a key role in the oxidation and corrosion protection of functional and structural materials. Here, we present a fully ab initio approach for understanding the thermodynamic driving force behind the initial phase selection among amorphous and crystalline structures for a surface film growing on a crystalline substrate. We apply the approach to elucidate the competition among corundum (α), spinel (γ), and amorphous (am.) Al2O3 films growing on aluminum metal. We show that the amorphous Al2O3 film becomes thermodynamically the most stable form below around ∼1 nm, that is, the relative energetic stabilities of thin polymorphic Al2O films follow am. < γ < α. As the film thickness increases, the relative stability relation first changes to γ < α < am. and then to the bulk limit of α < γ < am. The nanoscale γ films distort substantially to form exclusively four- and fivefold-coordinated Al–O polyhedra, lose the close-packed O framework, and become “amorphous-like”, that is, exhibit both short-range order and energetic characteristics that are commensurate with the amorphous form. Our results provide a quantitative, first-principles confirmation for the early hypotheses on the thermodynamic stability of amorphous surface films and provide insights for the critical role they play in oxidation protection. Handling the complexities associated with the initial film growth, including bulk, surface, interface, and strain energy effects in realistically complex ab initio simulations, we expect this approach to contribute to understanding of the mechanism behind effective passivation films for aluminum alloys and beyond.}},
